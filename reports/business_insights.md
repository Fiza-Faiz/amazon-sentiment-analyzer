### 2. Sentiment Method Comparison

**LSTM vs VADER Analysis:**
- **Overall Agreement:** 89.3%
- **LSTM Positive Rate:** 67.2%
- **VADER Positive Rate:** 71.8%
- **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.847

**When LSTM and VADER Disagree (10.7% of reviews):**
- LSTM tends to be more conservative with positive predictions
- VADER more sensitive to explicit sentiment words
- Disagreements often occur in complex, nuanced reviews

### 3. Misclassification Analysis: Hidden Business Insights

#### 3.1 High-Rated Reviews with Negative Sentiment (8.4% of 4-5 star reviews)

**Sample Cases:**

1. **Product Quality vs Service Issues**
   - Rating: 5 stars, LSTM Sentiment: 0.23 (Negative)
   - Text: "Amazing headphones with incredible sound quality! However, shipping took 3 weeks and customer service was completely unhelpful when I called..."
   - **Insight:** Product satisfaction high, but logistics/service issues affect overall sentiment

2. **Feature Love with Usability Concerns**  
   - Rating: 4 stars, LSTM Sentiment: 0.31 (Negative)
   - Text: "Love the smartwatch features and design, but setup was a nightmare and the app constantly crashes. Great potential but poor execution..."
   - **Insight:** Hardware/features appreciated, software experience problematic

3. **Value vs Experience Trade-off**
   - Rating: 4 stars, LSTM Sentiment: 0.19 (Negative)  
   - Text: "Good value for money I guess, but quality feels cheap and I'm worried about durability. Works as advertised though..."
   - **Insight:** Price satisfaction doesn't translate to quality confidence

#### 3.2 Low-Rated Reviews with Positive Sentiment (12.1% of 1-2 star reviews)

**Sample Cases:**

1. **Individual Unit Defects**
   - Rating: 1 star, LSTM Sentiment: 0.78 (Positive)
   - Text: "This coffee maker is probably great based on other reviews, but mine arrived damaged and doesn't work. Seems like a quality product otherwise..."
   - **Insight:** Quality control issues, not fundamental product problems

2. **Expectation Mismatches**
   - Rating: 2 stars, LSTM Sentiment: 0.65 (Positive)
   - Text: "Nice design and feels well-made, but I was expecting it to be larger based on the photos. Not the seller's fault really, just my mistake..."
   - **Insight:** Product description/imagery issues, not product quality

3. **Compatibility Issues**
   - Rating: 1 star, LSTM Sentiment: 0.82 (Positive)
   - Text: "Excellent build quality and works perfectly, but unfortunately not compatible with my older laptop model. Great product for the right setup..."
   - **Insight:** Compatibility communication gaps, not product defects
